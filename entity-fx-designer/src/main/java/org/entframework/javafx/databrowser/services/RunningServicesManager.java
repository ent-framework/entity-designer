/**
 * An instance of this class is member of AppState. So its scope is static.
 * <p>
 * This class exists because of the following problem:
 * It used to happen that the task executing SQLs didn't call any of its callback
 * methods. That was because in our ProgressUtil class the Service was just held as a
 * local variable. This caused the problem because in javafx.beans.property.ObjectPropertyBase.Listener
 * listeners are held in WeakRefernces and were garbage collected once and again when the
 * Service instance was local in ProgressUtil.
